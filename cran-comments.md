## New version

This is a new version submission. In this version we:

-  created `str_title_case()`. This function converts string to title case, capitalizing only the first letter of each word while ignoring articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.

-  added package-level documentation. The user can now use `?forstringr::forstringr` for basic package-level documentation.
