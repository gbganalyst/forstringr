# What is New in *forstringr*?

## 1.0.0 (2023-08-07)

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0.0 of `forstringr` package. This update includes the following new features and improvements:

-  Added `str_title_case()`. This function converts string to title case, capitalizing only the first letter of each word while ignoring articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.

-  Added package-level documentation. The user can now use `?forstringr::forstringr` for basic package-level documentation.

## 0.1.1 (2023-04-10) 

This update includes the following new features and improvements:

-  Added *str_englue()*. This function allows for easier string interpolation within curly braces for plot labelling in ggplot2. For example, any value wrapped in { } will be inserted into the string and it can also understand embracing, {{ }}, which automatically inserts a given variable name.

-  Improved error handling by adding meaningful error messages for all functions within the forstringr package. This will make it easier for users to identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise during their use of the package.

## 0.0.1 (2022-08-29) 

Added package logo, `community_data` (data containing whitespaces), `length_omit_na()`, and `str_extract_part()` functions, and modified unit tests.

## 0.0.0.9 (2022-07-20)

The development version of forstringr is now on Githhub.
